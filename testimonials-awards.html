<h4>A new web site</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wanted to tell you that I absolutely love the website you have developed for the <a href="http://spartansoccer.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CHS Girls Soccer team</a>.  I find it extremely helpful, easy to use, and navigate. For me, it is a much easier way to find the essential information I need without having to bounce back and forth between various emails we receive and the web.  It is a perfect example of how useful a website can be at dynamically providing a user with the information they need. I really enjoy the Historical Record section. That is quite fun to look at."</p>

<h4>A recent commission</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have been enjoying one of Pam's paintings hanging in my living room for a couple of years now. After giving my kitchen and dining nook a "makeover," I decided I needed a piece of art to finish it off and bring in some color, and I had something very specific in mind. I took my ideas to Pam. She was a joy to work with, and took my thoughts about a theme and color palette and interpreted it with her own touch of whimsy to deliver a painting that is really just perfect for the light and the space. I am so happy with it!"</p>

<h4>About the UUFC Mural</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>"The mural looks SO GOOD ! and the continuation along the walls - did you get a BEFORE picture with the mailboxes there? I love the bit down by the Nursery also. There is so much color in the whole department - it is really gratifying to see the changes, and you have been a big part of that. Thanks for being so flexible with the various requests and multiple opinions about the mural!"</p>
